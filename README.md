# Chaos
### Made for TPC Fall 2024 Game Jam.

It's a small chaos theory inspired demo.

To run in debug mode: `$cargo run`. After compilation, click anywhere on the screen and 20 particles will be spawned (with up to 1.0 screen pixel deviation = 0.1 simulated pixel deviation). Watch them diverge down the line, even though they started at a basically the same location!

This project uses Rust Bevy.
